PE may subcontract to Cosilico for platform work. Your grants fund applications, not infrastructure.\n\n2. **For investment side**: Cosilico is the infrastructure play. Pure platform, 100% product revenue. MyFriendBen-style apps would contract Cosilico as a vendor (not subgrant to PE).\n\n3. **The pitch**: 'Your portfolio companies like MyFriendBen have partial customer data. They can download our rules engine for free, but it's useless without knowing the customer's full financial picture. Our predictions API completes the profile.'\n\n## Materials:\n- /thesis - investor pitch (hidden page)\n- /structure - PE/Cosilico relationship explainer (hidden page)  \n- /pricing - pricing details (hidden page, pending finalization)\n\n## Questions to ask Yuri:\n- What's his new focus area at NextLadder?\n- Does NextLadder's investment arm look at infrastructure plays?\n- Would he intro to investment side if philanthropic fit isn't right?","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-17T21:47:15.131126-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-17T21:47:15.131126-05:00"}
