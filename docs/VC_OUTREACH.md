## Email Template

**Subject:** Cosilico - Tax/Benefits API Infrastructure for AI (Open Source)

Hi [Partner Name],

I'm building Cosilico, the "Stripe for policy calculations" - open source API infrastructure that lets AI systems calculate taxes, predict household attributes, and run population-scale simulations.

**The problem:** AI can't do taxes. [Johns Hopkins research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09992) shows GPT-4 achieves only 67% accuracy on tax questions (186/276 on SARA benchmark). Even if LLMs improve, deterministic tools are faster, auditable, and legally citable. Yet every AI financial assistant needs these calculations.

**The solution:** Deterministic tax/benefit calculations with legal citations + ML-based attribute prediction + microsimulation on 100M+ households.

**Why we can execute (the team built PolicyEngine):**

- 1M+ simulations run, used by UK Treasury and US Congress
- Already encoded: US federal + 50 states, UK, Canada (50% built)
- 50+ open source contributors
- Now rebuilding on modern infrastructure for commercial scale

I'd love to share our demo and discuss how we fit your [open source / fintech infrastructure / AI tools] thesis.

Best,
Max Ghenis
Founder, Cosilico
