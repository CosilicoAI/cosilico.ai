# International Expansion Plan (Draft)

Goal: prioritize countries where we can deliver credible rules + microdata quickly and win early users/partners.

## Prioritization Criteria
- Demand signals (partners, pilots, inbound)
- Rules source availability and complexity
- Microdata availability and calibration feasibility
- Language, legal, and hosting constraints
- Reuse of US/UK components (architecture, pipeline)

## Shortlist and Leads
- Canada (CA): federal and provinces (SPSD/M context); partners in academia/government
- Ireland/Netherlands/Germany (EU exemplars): EU-SILC access; select one to start
- Australia/New Zealand: ABS/NZ Stats microdata; English docs; policy interest
- Later: Spain/France/Italy/Poland (EU); India; Brazil; South Africa — contingent on partners

## Data and Rules Sources (Leads)
- EU-SILC (EU microdata): https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/microdata/european-union-statistics-on-income-and-living-conditions
- UK FRS (Family Resources Survey): https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/
- Canada SPSD/M (inputs and methods): https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/microsimulation/spsdm
- Australia (ABS HES): https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/finance
- New Zealand (HES): https://www.stats.govt.nz/

## Country Kit Template (create per target)
- Rules inventory + sources
- Data inventory + access path + license terms
- Calibration plan (inputs, targets, validation steps)
- Candidate early users + partners + funding angle
- Effort estimate and timeline (MVP; production)
