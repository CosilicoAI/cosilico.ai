# Organizational Structure Options (Draft)

This memo outlines options for Cosilico’s structure with pros/cons and open questions.

## Option A: Single For‑Profit (C‑Corp or PBC)
- Pros: simplicity, velocity, single board; straightforward fundraising
- Cons: perception risk for OSS stewardship; conflicts between commercial and neutral governance
- Notes: PBC charter can encode mission; requires careful trademark and governance policy

## Option B: Foundation + Wholly-Owned Sub (Mozilla‑style)
- Foundation (501(c)(3) or similar) owns IP, trademarks; sets governance for open-source core
- For‑profit subsidiary (C‑Corp or PBC) executes commercial work (hosted, SLAs, integrations)
- Pros: clear separation of stewardship vs. commercialization; durable neutrality
- Cons: more overhead; legal complexity; fundraising split

## Option C: Independent Foundation + Separate Operating Company
- Foundation holds trademarks, community governance; operating company licenses brand/IP
- Pros: strong neutrality; community trust
- Cons: coordination costs; licensing agreements; dual fundraising

## Governance Considerations
- Contributor agreements (CLA/DCO); code of conduct; RFC process; release governance
- Trademark policy ("Built on Cosilico"); brand usage guide
- Security and disclosure policy; compliance roadmap (SOC2/ISO27001 later)

## Business Model Patterns (Analogies)
- Red Hat: subscription/support for enterprise deployments of OSS
- GitLab/Confluent: open-core with enterprise features and hosted SaaS
- Mozilla: foundation stewardship with commercial subsidiary; revenue from partnerships/licensing

## Next Steps
- Draft recommended structure with legal counsel
- Define trademark and contributor policies
- Identify board composition and conflict-of-interest policy
- Prepare community charter, governance docs, and CLA/DCO templates
