# Research Workspace

Working area for market research and fundraising. Start with `TASKS.md` and fill sources as you go. Output should feed Investor Mode (Business Plan explorer), the deck (`/investor-deck`), and the data room.

Key files
- `TASKS.md` — master backlog
- `segments.md` — segment definitions and use cases
- `revenue_projections.csv` — per-customer projection scenarios (low/base/high)
- `sources.md` — source links (replace placeholders with real citations)
- `org-structures.md` — structure options and governance considerations
- `international-expansion.md` — country kits and sources
- `microdata-demand.md` — data product opportunities and validation
