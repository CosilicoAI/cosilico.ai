# Enhanced Microdata Demand (Draft)

Objective: map out demand for enriched synthetic microdata (with consumption) across sectors and define productization.

## Sectors and Use Cases
- Market research: local demand estimation, price elasticity, segment targeting
- Retail: store footprint planning, assortment, promo optimization
- Mobility/transport: transit fare and policy impacts on households
- Public health: eligibility + uptake modeling for health programs
- Energy/utilities: tariff impacts by household type; consumption shifts

## Data Product Candidates
- County-level synthetic households with demographics, income, taxes/benefits, and consumption vectors
- Scenario API: ingest policy changes; output demand shifts and distributional effects
- Cohort tagging: custom segments for partners (privacy-preserving)

## Validation Tasks
- Identify credible consumption sources (e.g., BLS CEX) and licensing
- Document augmentation method; publish validation metrics (fit, coverage)
- Pilot studies with 2–3 partners (market research firm, retailer, public agency)
